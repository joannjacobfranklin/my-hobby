            <p>My grandmother is my inspiration for gardening. I learnt from her that gardening is fun and it gives us happiness. She cares for her rose plants very much. Her roses were hit by some diseases and were in a very bad situation. The plants were in a state of dying. I wondered how my grandma will cure the plants, I thought they would die. But to my surprise, she cured them. God showed her the way. From this I learnt not to think that everything is gone when a plant suffers a disease. If I love and care for my plant with all my might, the plant will cure, don't lose hope.</p>
